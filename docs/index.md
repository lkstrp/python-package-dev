# Welcome

!!! note

    This guide and collection of resources was created as part of a workshop at the [Openmod 2025](https://forum.openmod.org/t/openmod-2025-announcement-concept-and-agenda-25-26-march-2025/5060/8) in Stockholm and to create a database for classic questions in general.

Software development can be hard and most people struggle with similar problems. But there are many low hanging fruits with tools and processes that make it easy to build your own open source software. 

This document will give you a brief introduction to the different steps you can take to get your project up running and sustain a healthy open source project.

## Topics
1. [Write](steps/write.md) - Get started with writing your code
- [Build](steps/build.md) - Create a python package
- [Test](steps/test.md) - Add testing strategies to your project
- [Format](steps/format.md) - Use code formatters to make your code look nice
- [Lint](steps/lint.md) - Use linters to avoid common mistakes
- [Document](steps/document.md) - Publish documentation and a API reference
- [Release](steps/release.md) - Choose a release strategy
- [Publish](steps/publish.md) - Get your package out to the world
- [Maintain](steps/maintain.md) - Keep your project alive

!!! info

    It is not a complete guide but rather a collection of resources and links to help you get started. The goal is to provide you with a starting point and some best practices that you can follow to make your project more successful.

## Guide for the Workshop

The document only provides information. During the workshop there are multiple things you can do:

- **Demo project**

    Each section links to a demo project that shows how you could implement the respective topic. You can create your own project and check the demo project as an example. Or also jump in at the topic where you are interested in. Maybe publish the project to the PyPi test server or play around with different testing strategies.

- **Improve your own project**

    If you have a project that you want to improve, you can jump in at any topic and work on your own project. Maybe it's time to add a formatter to your project and discover some linting rules. Or you start to add some tests which you always wanted to do. Maybe you have a running PyPi package already, but you want to make it available via conda as well.

- **Share your own experience**

    If you know most of the common package development steps already, you can share your own experience. Maybe this guide misses a topic you think is important or you think GitLab is a better alternative to GitHub.
