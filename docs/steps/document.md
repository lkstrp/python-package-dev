# Document

To provide documentation there are basically two target groups and two ways to provide documentation.

- **Target Groups**:
    - **Users**: People who will use your software.
    - **Developers**: People who will contribute to your software.
- **Ways to Provide Documentation**:
    - **Inline Documentation**: Comments, docstrings and also type hints in your code. This helps
        developers and yourself to understand the code and can be used to generate documentation automatically.
    - **Dedicated Documentation**: A separate documentation site that provides a more detailed overview of your software and how to use it.
