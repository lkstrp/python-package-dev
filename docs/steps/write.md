# 1. Write

When you are reading this it can be assumed that you are already familiar with Python. Therefore this section will not cover any basics but just link a couple of resources. Otherwise there are two appeals to use Git and AI in your process.

## Version control
If you are developing software you want to use git. For the rest of the guide it is assumed and necessary that you are using git. If not go and [learn git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) now.

If you think you know git, you might want to check out some **advanced git** tips in this [guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/advanced-overview). The difference between merging and rebasing is a common source of confusion, git hooks are later used git worktrees are a common "why didn't I know this before" moment.


## Coding assistant
These days when talking about writing code, we have to talk about AI. There are many tools out there that can help you write code faster and better. The most common ones are [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or just copying to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). And many more come up every day. This guide does not provide any more information about these tools, but just the appeal to check them out and the the notice that you can even use those tools with privacy in mind.

### Privacy compliant ways
Of course LLMs are a great help but you may have privacy concerns or are just not allowed to use them.
Using models from OpenAI or Anthropic will send your code to their servers.

Self hosting these days is very easy. There are many [open source models](https://ollama.com/search) that you can run on your own machine. With [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) you can run them with a single command and with [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) you can use them via a great web interface. [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) provides you the Copilot style auto completion. 

The main obstacle is the hardware. To run these models you need a decent GPU. But this is just a notice that those problems are solvable and you should jump on the train.
