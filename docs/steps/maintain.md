# 10. Maintain

Finally, you need to keep your project alive. Maintaining an open source project is just as important as creating it. A well-maintained project attracts more users and contributors, while an abandoned project can quickly become obsolete or insecure. The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/):material-file-document: has many great resources on how to maintain your project (e.g. [What does it mean to be a maintainer?](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/)).
